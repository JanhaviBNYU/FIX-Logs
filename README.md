# FIX Logs

The project is automating FIX logs processing(using Python) and storing the data in the normalized database. FIX is the primary protocol used for communication between various financial entities in the stock markets today. This involves the exchange of several messages using fixed tag pairs â€“ tag pair values have distinct meanings as per the FIX protocol, but our focus is limited to the most important tag pair fields. This project works on FIX log files which contain details on previous message exchanges of 35 = D (Single Order) and 35 = 8 (Execution Report) message types.
